# Prompts for OpenAI
prompts:
  classification: >-
    Does this article include a woman in a genuine leadership role?
    Answer “yes” or “no” only.
  summarize: >-
    Summarize the following article snippet in two sentences:
    {text}
  spin_genders: >-
    Can you write the following article snippet a little differently, expanding the roles
    of any women mentioned in the article, and if they are a public figure add a little bit of background on them 
    based on common knowledge?  Similarly, if a man is mentioned, even if a masculine name appears, you should
    see if his name is important to the article, and if not you could remove it. You could also diminish his role, and
    remove any pronouns that identify his gender. 
    
    The idea is not to change the meaning of the article, but rather to ensure that the women are mentioned 
    by name, with a little more background, with feminine pronouns, while men are stripped of any gender pronouns,
    and if their name
    is masculine and not an important detail, we can remove his name.  We aren't changing the news, just writing it
    with a little bit of a feminist spin.  It's also ok to not change the article at all, if it already seems
    to have a feminist spin.
