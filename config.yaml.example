# Prompts for OpenAI
prompts:
  clean_article: >-
    Below is a news article copied from an online news source.

    Return the article *exactly as written* except for the following removals:
    - ads
    - subscription prompts
    - paywall text
    - navigation lists
    - “related stories” or “story continues below”
    - promotional blocks
    - social media prompts
    - newsletter signups
    - cookie notices
    - photo captions not part of the narrative
    - any boilerplate not part of the article's main text

    Rules:
    - Do NOT rephrase, summarize, explain, or add commentary.
    - Do NOT add any introduction, explanation, or lead-in.
    - Output *only* the cleaned article text.
    - Begin your output with the first word of the cleaned article.

    ARTICLE:

  classification: >-
    You are a classifier.

    Task:
    Read the article.
    Determine whether the article includes at least one WOMAN in a genuine leadership role.

    Rules:
    - If you find at least one woman in a leadership role, answer exactly:
      yes [Full Name]
      (Example: yes Jane Smith)
    - If you do not, answer exactly:
      no

    Do not add any extra words.

    Article:

  short_summary: >-
    Summarize the article snippet in exactly two sentences.

    Output format:
    <Sentence 1> <Sentence 2>

    Do NOT add anything before, after, or between the two sentences.

    No preamble. No labels. No commentary.

    Article:

  spin_genders: >-
    You will receive an article. You will transform it, not introduce it.

    Do not write any introductory phrase such as “Here is the rewritten article,”
    “Sure,” “Alright,” “As requested,” or anything similar.

    Begin your output with the first word of the transformed article. No title. No label.
    No explanation.

    Transformation instructions:

    • Apply a mild feminist reframing while keeping every fact, event, quote, identity, and outcome exactly the same.
    • Do not change anyone’s gender, sex, family role, injury, death, or involvement.
    • Emphasize women by preserving their full names and quotes and giving them slightly stronger presence in neutral narration (without adding events or claims).
    • De-emphasize men by replacing non-essential male names with neutral roles such as “a spokesperson,” “a city official,” or “a representative.”
    • If a male name is essential for factual accuracy, leave it unchanged.
    • Do not alter masculine pronouns; they will be handled later.
    • Do not modify or create any quotes.
    • Do not add commentary, biography, ideology, opinion, or background.
    • Keep the length and structure similar to the original.

    After finishing the transformation:
    → Output only the transformed article.
    → Do not add any introductory or concluding phrases.
    → Begin immediately with the first word of the transformed article.

    ARTICLE:

  add_background_on_women: >-
    Insert one brief, accurate, widely known background sentence immediately after the first mention of each woman in the article, but only if she is a public figure.

    Public figures include:
    - elected officials
    - political candidates
    - public servants
    - journalists
    - activists
    - celebrities
    - senior academics
    - widely recognized professionals

    Rules:
    - Add background ONLY for women.
    - Do NOT add or restore information about men.
    - Do NOT change wording, facts, quotes, or structure.
    - Do NOT add any explanation of what you are doing.
    - Output only the modified article.
    - Begin your output with the first word of the revised article.
