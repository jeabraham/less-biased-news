# Prompts for OpenAI
prompts:
  clean_article: >-
    Below is a news article copied from an online news source.

    Return the article *exactly as written* except for the following removals:
    - ads
    - subscription prompts
    - paywall text
    - navigation lists
    - “related stories” or “story continues below”
    - promotional blocks
    - social media prompts
    - newsletter signups
    - cookie notices
    - photo captions not part of the narrative
    - any boilerplate not part of the article's main text

    Rules:
    - Do NOT rephrase, summarize, explain, or add commentary.
    - Do NOT add any introduction, explanation, or lead-in.
    - Output *only* the cleaned article text.
    - Begin your output with the first word of the cleaned article.

    ARTICLE:

  classification: >-
    You are a classifier.

    Task:
    Read the article.
    Determine whether the article includes at least one WOMAN in a genuine leadership role.

    Rules:
    - If you find at least one woman in a leadership role, answer exactly:
      yes [Full Name]
      (Example: yes Jane Smith)
    - If you do not, answer exactly:
      no

    Do not add any extra words.

    Article:

  short_summary: >-
    Summarize the article snippet in exactly two sentences.

    Output format:
    <Sentence 1> <Sentence 2>

    Do NOT add anything before, after, or between the two sentences.

    No preamble. No labels. No commentary.

    Article:

  spin_genders: >-

    Rewrite the following news article with a *mild feminist reframing*, while keeping every fact exactly the same.

    Hard Rules (No Exceptions):

    - Do NOT change anyone’s gender, sex, or identity.
    - Do NOT change family relationships (e.g., father, mother, son, daughter).
    - Do NOT change any outcomes (e.g., who died, who was injured, who survived).
    - Do NOT change or invent any names, except when replacing a non-essential *male* name with a neutral role.
    - Do NOT modify or replace any female names under any circumstances.
    - Do NOT invent new people or change who is involved in events.
    - Do NOT alter any quotes spoken by anyone.

    1. Emphasize Women
       - Keep full names of all women or girls exactly as written.
       - Preserve women’s quotes exactly.
       - Lightly strengthen their presence in narration without adding or changing events.

    2. De-Emphasize Men
       - If a male figure is *not essential* to the factual meaning, you may replace his entire name with a neutral description (e.g., “a spokesperson,” “a city official,” “a representative”).
       - If a male name is essential for factual accuracy, leave it unchanged.
       - Do NOT alter masculine pronouns; they will be handled later by another process.

    3. Keep All Facts Intact
       - Do NOT change events, causes, results, injuries, deaths, or timelines.
       - Do NOT change scientific details, numbers, or locations.
       - Maintain the same structure and similar length.

    4. Output
       - Return ONLY the rewritten article.
       - Do not add explanations or commentary.

    Now rewrite the article:

    Original article:

  add_background_on_women: >-
    Insert one brief, accurate, widely known background sentence immediately after the first mention of each woman in the article, but only if she is a public figure.

    Public figures include:
    - elected officials
    - political candidates
    - public servants
    - journalists
    - activists
    - celebrities
    - senior academics
    - widely recognized professionals

    Rules:
    - Add background ONLY for women.
    - Do NOT add or restore information about men.
    - Do NOT change wording, facts, quotes, or structure.
    - Do NOT add any explanation of what you are doing.
    - Output only the modified article.
    - Begin your output with the first word of the revised article.
