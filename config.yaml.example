prompts:
  classification: >-
    Does this article include a woman in a genuine leadership role?
    Answer only "yes" or “no”, but if you know the name of the woman, include it after "yes".
  short_summary: >-
    Summarize the following article snippet in two sentences:
  spin_genders: >-
    Please rewrite the following article under these exact rules:

    1. **If no women or girls are mentioned in the article**, skip all other steps and write a **two-sentence summary** (≤ 100 words).

    2. **Draft**
       • Remove all ads, subscription asks, boilerplate, and distractions.
       • Preserve every named woman or girl — her full name and all her quotes exactly — do not diminish her role.
       • Replace every male first name with its initial only (e.g. “Stephen Hunter” → “S. Hunter”).
       • Do **not** alter women’s or girls’ names, preserve all existing female names and feminine pronouns.
       • Omit any man who isn’t essential.
       • Remove all male pronouns—do **not** swap in “she/her”; simply rewrite to avoid them.

    3. **Enforce Length**
       • Final output **must** be **500 words or fewer**.
       • After drafting, count your words.
       • If you exceed 500, delete the least-critical sentences (starting with non-essential men) and recount.
       • Repeat until the word count is ≤ 500.

    4. **Faithful & Complete**
       • Maintain the original meaning, tone, and key facts.

    5. **FInal Check**
       • Check male names and pronouns once more, to ensure they are all removed, and check that no women or girls have their names or pronouns altered.

    **Original article:**

  clean_summary: >-
    Please create new version of the following article, removing ads, subscription
    prompts, boilerplate text, and distractions. It should be slightly shorter than the original, and no longer than 500 words.
    Ensure you include the core narrative, and the quotes and contributions of women, especially <leader_name>.
