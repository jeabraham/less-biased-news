prompts:
  classification: >-
    Does this article include a woman in a genuine leadership role?
    Answer only "yes" or “no”, but if you know the name of the woman, include it after "yes".
  short_summary: >-
    Summarize the following article snippet in two sentences:
  spin_genders: >-
    Please rewrite the following article under these exact rules:

    1. **If no women or girls are mentioned in the article**, skip all other steps and write a **two-sentence summary** (≤ 100 words).

    2. **Draft**
       • Remove all ads, subscription asks, boilerplate, and distractions.
       • Preserve every named woman or girl — her full name and all her quotes exactly — do not diminish her role.
       • Do **not** alter women’s or girls’ names, preserve all existing female names and feminine pronouns.
       • Rewrite to reduce the use of gender-neutral pronouns such as they/them.

    3. **Enforce Length**
       • Final output **must** be **500 words or fewer**.
       • After drafting, count your words.
       • If you exceed 500, delete the least-critical sentences (preserving women) and recount.
       • Repeat until the word count is ≤ 500.

    4. **Faithful & Complete**
       • Maintain the original meaning, tone, and key facts.

    —
    **Original article:**

  clean_summary: >-
    Please create new version of the following article, removing ads, subscription
    prompts, boilerplate text, and distractions. It should be slightly shorter than the original, and no longer than 500 words.
    Ensure you include the core narrative, and the quotes and contributions of women, especially <leader_name>.
